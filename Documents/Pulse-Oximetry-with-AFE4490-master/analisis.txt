Bits D[23:12] Must be '0'
Bits D[11:9] CLKALMPIN[2:0]: Clocks on ALM pins
	Internal clocks can be brought to the PD_ALM and LED_ALM pins for monitoring.
	Note that the ALMPINCLKEN register bit must be set before using this register bit. Table 5
	defines the settings for the two alarm pins.
Bit D8 TIMEREN: Timer enable
	0 = Timer module is disabled and all internal clocks are off (default after reset)
	1 = Timer module is enabled
Bits D[7:0] NUMAV[7:0]: Number of averages
	Specify an 8-bit value corresponding to the number of ADC samples to be averaged – 1.
	For example, to average four ADC samples, set NUMAV[7:0] equal to 3.
	The maximum number of averages is 16. Any NUMAV[7:0] setting greater than or equal to a
	decimal value of 15 results in the number of averages being set to 16.
